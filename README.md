MIT Pac-Man Exercise


Title:
Pac Man Factory Game

Description:

This is a Pac Man game that utilizes HTML and JS to create flying Pac Man.  You can add more PacMan or increase flying velocity

How to run/deploy:
1.	Download the following files: index.html, pacmen.js, images folder (containing PacMan .png files 1-4)
2.	Place these files into the same directory
3.	Load the .html file into browser of choice.  To edit, load .html and .js files into VS code text editor and install “Live Server” plugin for easy testing 

Roadmap:

I might try to add some additional buttons and/or images with different colors or styles to add some variety to the types of Pac Men that can be created
